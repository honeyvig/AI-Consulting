# AI-Consulting
Looking for some consulting to gain clarity on what kind of functionality I can add with AI, and how I can design and use it when building software. It's limitations and what it. can do.

Want to turn stored data into a whole bunch of questions and have it used in chat for responses, and want to explore what is involved. Would like to explore strategies and how its done.
===================
To address your need for consulting and clarity on integrating AI functionality into your software, the following Python script outlines an approach to turn stored data into questions and responses using AI, particularly focusing on designing AI systems and their limitations.

This script will guide you through:

    Storing and analyzing data: We assume you have structured data (e.g., from a database or CSV) that the AI will analyze to generate questions.
    Question Generation: Using an AI model like GPT-4, you will generate questions based on stored data.
    AI Model Responses: The AI will respond to questions based on stored data (could be data from your database, document, or any other source).
    Interactive Chatbot: Using the AI for real-time question-answer interactions.

Steps Overview:

    Stored Data: Assume the data is in a database or a file, and you need to generate questions based on that.
    AI Model: Using GPT (or similar AI models), you can generate questions and responses.
    Chatbot Interface: Integrate this into a chatbot framework to interact with users.

Prerequisites:

    Python Libraries:
        openai: To interact with AI models like GPT.
        mysql-connector-python (if you want to connect to a MySQL database).

pip install openai mysql-connector-python

Example Code:

Below is a Python script that demonstrates how to use GPT to generate questions from stored data, use the AI to answer those questions, and structure them for a chatbot-like interaction:

import openai
import mysql.connector

# Set your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

# Connect to MySQL database (or use another data source)
def connect_to_db():
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="your-db-host",  # e.g., 'localhost'
        user="your-db-username",
        password="your-db-password",
        database="your-database-name"
    )
    return connection

# Retrieve stored data from the database (or use another source)
def get_data_from_db():
    connection = connect_to_db()
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    # Example query to fetch data
    cursor.execute("SELECT column_name FROM your_table_name")
    data = cursor.fetchall()  # Returns a list of tuples (e.g., [(data1,), (data2,)])
    
    cursor.close()
    connection.close()
    
    return [item[0] for item in data]  # Extracting the text data from the tuple

# Generate questions based on stored data using AI
def generate_questions(data):
    questions = []
    
    for text in data:
        prompt = f"Based on the following data, generate a question:\n\n{text}\n\nQuestion:"
        
        # Request AI to generate a question
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            model="text-davinci-003",  # You can also use GPT-4 if available
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=50,
            temperature=0.7
        )
        
        question = response.choices[0].text.strip()
        questions.append(question)
    
    return questions

# Answer questions based on data using AI
def generate_answer(question, data):
    prompt = f"Given the data below, provide an answer to the following question:\n\nData: {data}\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\nAnswer:"
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",  # You can also use GPT-4 if available
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    
    answer = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return answer

# Chatbot Interaction Logic
def chatbot():
    print("Welcome to the AI Chatbot! Type 'exit' to end the conversation.")
    
    # Example: Retrieve stored data from database (you can modify this part)
    data = get_data_from_db()
    
    # Generate a list of questions based on stored data
    questions = generate_questions(data)
    
    for idx, question in enumerate(questions, 1):
        print(f"Question {idx}: {question}")
        
        # Get AI's answer for the generated question
        answer = generate_answer(question, data)
        print(f"Answer {idx}: {answer}\n")
        
        # Interaction: Chatbot answers based on data
        while True:
            user_input = input("You can ask questions or type 'exit' to stop: ").strip()
            if user_input.lower() == "exit":
                print("Ending chat.")
                return
            else:
                # Answer the user's input using AI
                answer_to_user = generate_answer(user_input, data)
                print(f"AI: {answer_to_user}")
                
# Main execution logic
if __name__ == "__main__":
    chatbot()

Explanation:

    Database Connection: The connect_to_db() function connects to a MySQL database where your data is stored. You can replace this with any other data source (like CSV, API, or file).

    Question Generation:
        generate_questions() takes the text data and prompts the AI model (GPT) to generate questions based on the data.
        This is done by creating a prompt like: Based on the following data, generate a question: followed by the data.

    Answer Generation:
        generate_answer() answers questions based on the stored data. It generates a prompt where the question and data are provided as context, and the AI responds with an answer.

    Chatbot Interface:
        The chatbot() function provides an interactive loop where the user can ask questions. The AI generates answers based on stored data using the model. You can interact with the AI and ask custom questions as well.

    API Integration:
        This script uses the OpenAI API (openai.Completion.create) to generate questions and answers. You need an OpenAI API key to use this.
        Adjust the model (e.g., text-davinci-003 or GPT-4) based on your needs and availability.

Enhancements:

    Limitations and Design:
        Data Quality: AI model performance heavily depends on the quality of data you store. Ensure the data is well-structured and relevant for generating meaningful questions.
        Contextual Understanding: The AI may struggle with generating questions for data that lacks clarity or context.
        Fine-Tuning: You could fine-tune models like GPT on your own dataset to improve question generation quality, especially if you're working with specialized or domain-specific data.
        Data Size: The more extensive your data set, the more processing power youâ€™ll need to efficiently generate meaningful questions and answers.

    Advanced Use Cases:
        Contextual Chatbot: Implement a system where AI provides answers based on real-time conversations with users. This allows you to build interactive chatbots that can understand and respond to questions based on stored data.

    Long-Term Strategies:
        Continuous Learning: As you get more data, you can regularly update the AI model with new data, improving its understanding and ability to generate more insightful answers.
        Workflow Automation: You can integrate this chatbot system into a larger software tool that automates workflows based on data-driven insights.

Conclusion:

This script helps you explore AI integration in a practical scenario: transforming stored data into useful questions and leveraging AI for interaction. This approach gives you flexibility in building intelligent systems that respond to business or operational data in a conversational manner.
